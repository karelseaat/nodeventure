 Project Title: AST* Pathfinding Game with Enemies and Portraits

Description:
This project is a simple game implemented in Godot Engine that showcases the A* pathfinding algorithm for navigating characters (also known as 'bolletjes' in this context) on a grid. The game includes additional features such as enemies, portraits that warn players of incoming enemies, and an intuitive user interface.

The game's primary objective is to collect items represented by various icons (leven, voedsel, en brood), while avoiding enemies. To make the game more engaging, we have added a water resource that needs to be replenished.

Key Features:
1. A* Pathfinding Algorithm: The game uses the A* pathfinding algorithm for efficient navigation of characters and enemies on a grid-based map.
2. Enemies with Portraits: Enemies roam the map, and players can be warned of their approach by portraits that appear when they get close.
3. Item Collection: Players must collect items represented by different icons to progress through the game.
4. Water Resource: The water resource needs to be replenished periodically for the player's character to survive.
5. User Interface: An intuitive user interface provides essential information, such as the player's score and remaining lives.
6. Game Over Screen: A clear game over screen informs players of their status and encourages them to try again.

Dependencies:
- Godot Engine (version 3.3.4.stable)
